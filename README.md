please mention the name of author and add his
name to any papers or reports published with this ideas here.

Also if you prefer F90, the code written in easy way to
convert it to F90 - just copy and paste and change the 
looping functions, etc...

However, I recommend you to use C++ version due to many
changes coming in the near future... 

to compile the program you need to have:
GNU C/C++
Blitz++ library

The code is solving NS equation on orthogonal meshes.

REMEBER:
The code is still under development process - please ask the
me every 2nd month for the new and updated version.

Things under developent:
- corrections for non-orthogonality and highly skew grids
- XML configuration files for universality
- relative iteration progress notifications
- particle transport 
- postprocessing functions
